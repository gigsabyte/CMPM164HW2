# CMPM164 Homework 2
## Part A: Create a simple 3D scene in Unreal 4.23
The Unreal project containing the scene is in the PartA folder. You can view a video of the scene [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O8z64kg-FEdWBZByGeB34ziiiTji3Ztf/view?usp=sharing).

## Part B: Create a Whitted-style ray tracer
The Whitted-style ray tracer can be downloaded as the standalone executable [PartB.exe](https://github.com/gigsabyte/CMPM164HW2/blob/master/PartB.exe). When running the executable, give it some time to render. I promise it works... 
The source code is located in the Part B folder, along with PPM file outputs. The following is an example output converted to PNG:
